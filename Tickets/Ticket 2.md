The goal of this ticket is to make it function how its intended to function. 

you can use basic useState management to make it work, or you can skip straight to advance state management with a store and reducers,may be less work in the long run.

1. create a state folder
2. build the store and reducers
3. track the goals, tasks for each goal, and due date.
4. can use simpler useState hooks to track progress bar.
5. make the buttons work
